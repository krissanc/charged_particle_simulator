## Electric Field

### Coulomb's Law

The electric field due to a point charge:

```
E = k * q / r² * r̂
```

Where:
- `E` = Electric field vector (N/C or V/m)
- `k = 1/(4πε₀) ≈ 8.99×10⁹ N·m²/C²` = Coulomb constant
- `q` = Charge (C)
- `r` = Distance from charge to evaluation point (m)
- `r̂` = Unit vector from charge to evaluation point

### Total Field from Multiple Charges

The total electric field is the vector sum of contributions from all charges:

```
E_total = Σ E_i
```

Where `E_i` is the field from the i-th charge.

## Force on Charged Particle

### Lorentz Force (Electric Component)

```
F = q * E
```

Where:
- `F` = Force vector (N)
- `q` = Charge of particle (C)
- `E` = Total electric field at particle position (N/C)

## Particle Motion

### Newton's Second Law

```
F = m * a
```

Where:
- `F` = Net force (N)
- `m` = Mass (kg)
- `a` = Acceleration (m/s²)

### Velocity Verlet Integration

For stable long-term integration:

```
v(t+Δt) = v(t) + a(t) * Δt
x(t+Δt) = x(t) + v(t) * Δt + 0.5 * a(t) * Δt²
```

## Retarded Potentials

### Retarded Time

The field at a point depends on the charge's position at an earlier time:

```
t_ret = t - |r|/c
```

Where:
- `t_ret` = Retarded time (s)
- `t` = Current time (s)
- `|r|` = Distance from charge to evaluation point (m)
- `c = 2.998×10⁸ m/s` = Speed of light

### Retarded Field

The electric field uses the charge's position at the retarded time:

```
E_retarded = k * q / r² * r̂
```

Where `r` and `r̂` are calculated using the charge's position at `t_ret`.

## Physical Constants

- **Elementary Charge**: `e = 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ C`
- **Electron Mass**: `m_e = 9.109×10⁻³¹ kg`
- **Proton Mass**: `m_p = 1.673×10⁻²⁷ kg`
- **Speed of Light**: `c = 2.998×10⁸ m/s`
- **Coulomb Constant**: `k = 8.988×10⁹ N·m²/C²`
- **Permittivity of Free Space**: `ε₀ = 8.854×10⁻¹² C²/(N·m²)`

## Field Line Generation

Field lines are generated by numerically integrating:

```
dx/dt = E / |E|
```

Using RK4 (Runge-Kutta 4th order) integration.
